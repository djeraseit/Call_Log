# Call_Log

Have the ability to call another script if a new call is recieved. (i.e. be able to email or send a message of some sort, with the personal caller id info.)

So there is a script to retrive the call log from the OBIHAI OBi100, and add it to a mysql database, and trigger another script if there are new calls.

Lookup the number via various APIs

Automatically report obnoxious call (SPAM)


Instead of using simultaneous ring with a mobile phone and an office phone, we assign one destination as a Twilio number. We then answer (and hang up on!) robocallers.

After a quick, one-time setup, incoming calls are able to be analyzed. If it’s a good caller, we instruct Twilio to return a busy signal and the call continues ringing on your phone, just like normal. Both the caller and the recipient don’t notice anything different from making and receiving a regular phone call.

But if it’s a robocall, we answer the call immediately. To prevent false positives, instead of just hanging up, the caller is presented with an audio CAPTCHA. If the caller passes the test and proves they are human, the call is allowed through. If they fail, we hang up the call.

## TODO

1. Add duration of call in history (i.e. Call start, call answered, call ended)
2. Multicurl to get caller info and hangup at the same time.
3. Create SaaS using syslog function
4. Send to Loggly
5. Automatically record calls
6. Export call history to CSV
7. Integration with OpenCNAM
8. Admin Web interface to view the calls, add caller id info and analytics
9. Check robocall and SPAM score with Youmail
10. Database connectivity
11. Redis queue/memcache functionality
12. Twilio integration
13. Look into append mode for file_put_contents
14. Queue spam lookup for new calls
