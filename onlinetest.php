/**
 * I was having trouble with socket connections timing out reliably. Sometimes,
 * my timeout would be reached. Other times, the connect would fail after three
 * to six seconds. I finally figured out it had to do with trying to connect to
 * a routable, non-localhost address. It seems the socket_connect call would
 * not fail immediately for those connections. This function is what I finally
 * ended up with that reliably connects to a working server, fails quickly for
 * a server that has an address/port that is not reachable and will reach the
 * timeout for routable addresses that are not up.

 * Failed to connect to 10.1.2.30:4730. (timed out after 102.1051ms)
 * NULL
 *
 * Trying: Up but not listening...
 * Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1:7676. (111: Connection refused; after 0.051ms)
 * NULL
